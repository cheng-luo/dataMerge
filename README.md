Data Project
=========

# Usage
* just execute the R script "run_analysis.R" to create the two datasets
* make sure the unzipped dataset folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" is stored in the same folder as "run_analysis.R"

# Generated data files
* the script will create two subfolders called dataset1 and dataset2 under "UCI HAR Dataset/merge"
* All together, there will be six generated data files
  1. merge/dataset1/X.txt
  2. merge/dataset1/y.txt
  3. merge/dataset1/subject.txt
  4. merge/dataset2/X.txt
  5. merge/dataset2/y.txt
  6. merge/dataset2/subject.txt
